# VBA-challenge

There are two macros in this project. The both have the same code for the first half of the project when calculating the four columns (Ticker    Quarterly Change    Percent Change    Total Stock Volume). However, they use two different methods while when calculating maximum and minimum percent changes and maximum total volume.

The first macro uses for loops and if statements
The second macro uses arrays and WorksheetFunction.Index and Match.

I assume the first macro is the intended method for the second half of this project which can be used for grading. I included the second macro for practice with using arrays and learning about "WorksheetFunciton"
